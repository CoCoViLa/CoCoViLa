/**
 * A Java 8 grammar for ANTLR 4 derived from the Java Language Specification
 * chapter 19.
 *
 * NOTE: This grammar results in a generated parser that is much slower
 *       than the Java 7 grammar in the grammars-v4/java directory. This
 *     one is, however, extremely close to the spec.
 *
 * You can test with
 *
 *  $ antlr4 Java8.g4
 *  $ javac *.java
 *  $ grun Java8 compilationUnit *.java
 *
 * Or,
~/antlr/code/grammars-v4/java8 $ java Test .
